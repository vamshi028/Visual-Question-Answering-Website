# Visual-Question-Answering-Website
This project is a voice-based interface designed to provide a hands-free and interactive experience for users who prefer or require voice commands to interact with an application. The interface is particularly beneficial for users who find traditional interfaces challenging or inconvenient, such as those with mobility impairments or those who simply prefer a more convenient way to interact with technology.
The system allows users to capture images using their device's camera and then ask questions about the captured images. The interface processes the questions and provides spoken responses, ensuring that users can interact seamlessly without needing to manually input text or navigate through a traditional user interface. This approach enhances accessibility and convenience, making the application more user-friendly for a wide range of users.
The project is built using a combination of web technologies and Python. The front-end is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface. The back-end is powered by Flask, a lightweight web framework, which handles image capture, question processing, and response generation. The system uses the Google Generative AI API to generate responses to user questions based on the captured images. Additionally, the project integrates Amazon Polly for text-to-speech conversion, providing spoken responses to users.
Overall, this project aims to create a more inclusive and accessible user experience by leveraging voice commands and reducing the need for manual input. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of users who benefit from voice-based interactions.
